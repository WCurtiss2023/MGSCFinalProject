## Part 1: Data Loading and Data Cleaning 

1a) Loading Data. 
```{r}

library('tidyverse')
options(scipen = 50)
set.seed(1861)
setwd("~/downloads")
unicorns <- read_csv("unicorns.csv") 

```


1b) Opening Data. 

```{r}

head(unicorns)

```

3a) CleaningData. 
```{r}



```




## Part 2: Summary Statistics 

2a) Response to part a. 


```{r}

# code for 2a

```


2b) Response to part b. 


```{r}

# code for 2b

```
